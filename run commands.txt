1️⃣ Backend (Spring Boot)

Open CMD in carcrud/ folder.

Run:

mvn spring-boot:run


Check that it’s running: http://localhost:8080/api/cars (or whatever CRUD endpoints you made).

Optionally open H2 console: http://localhost:8080/h2-console → jdbc:h2:mem:testdb → username: sa → no password.

💡 This shows CRUD works and your backend is alive.

2️⃣ Frontend (React)

Open CMD in frontend/ folder.

Run:

npm install
npm start


Your browser should open http://localhost:3000 showing your React UI.

Try creating, updating, deleting a car—demonstrate CRUD working live.
